# Solar Radio Burst Simulation using GANs
This repository contains code for simulating solar radio bursts using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The GAN model is designed to generate synthetic solar radio burst images, which can be useful for various applications in solar physics research.

# Requirements
- matplotlib
- numpy
- torch
- opencv-python
- Pillow
- torchvision

Install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install matplotlib numpy torch opencv-python Pillow torchvision
```

# Dataset
The solar radio burst dataset used for training is located in the "Type_II_trainingset" directory. The images in the dataset are resized to 128x128 pixels.

# Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to create a numpy array of images. The processed data is then saved to an npz file (SRB_images.npz).

# Dataset Visualization
A utility function plot_images is defined to visualize a grid of images. The function saves the generated images to the "Generated3" directory and also displays them inline.

# Model Architecture
### Generator
The generator is defined as a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch. It takes random noise as input and generates synthetic solar radio burst images.

### Discriminator
The discriminator is another CNN designed to classify whether an input image is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

# Training
The GAN model is trained for a specified number of epochs. During training, the discriminator and generator are updated alternatively to improve their performance. The training progress is logged, and fake images are generated and saved at regular intervals.

# Results
Generated images and the corresponding losses (discriminator and generator) are saved and displayed for each epoch.

# Usage
1. Ensure that the required packages are installed.
1. Download the solar radio burst dataset and place it in the "Type_II_trainingset" directory.
1. Run the provided code to train the GAN model and generate synthetic solar radio burst images.
  
Note: Adjust hyperparameters, such as batch size, learning rate, and model architecture, as needed for your specific use case.

Feel free to experiment with different settings and contribute to the development of realistic solar radio burst simulations!
